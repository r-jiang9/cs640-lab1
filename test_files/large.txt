Although each of the world's countries

  
would like to dispute this fact,

  
we French know the truth:

  
The best food in the world
is made in France.

  
The best food in France
is made in Paris.

  
And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.

  
Gusteau's restaurant
is the toast of Paris,

  
booked five months in advance.

  
And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine

  
has made his competitors envious.

  
He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.

  
Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
Anyone Can Cook!

  
Climbed to the top of the bestseller list.

  
But not everyone
celebrates its success.

  
Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!

  
What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.

  
I, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.

  
And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.

  
This is me.

  
I think it's apparent
I need to rethink my life a little bit.

  
What's my problem?

  
First of all, I'm a rat.

  
Which means life is hard.

  
And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.

  
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

  
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

  
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

  
This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.

  
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

  
This is my dad. He's never impressed.

  
He also happens to be
the leader of our clan.

  
So, what's wrong
with having highly developed senses?

  
- Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

  
Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison.

  
Suddenly, Dad didn't think
my talent was useless.

  
I was feeling pretty good about my gift,

  
until Dad gave me a job.

  
Clean.

  
Clean.

  
That's right. Poison checker.

  
Cleanerific.

  
Cleanerino.

  
Close to godliness.

  
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

  
Never mind. Move on.

  
Well, it made my dad proud.

  
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

  
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

  
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

  
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

  
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

  
Let's just say
we have different points of view.

  
This much I knew:

  
If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.

  
But to my dad...

  
Food is fuel.

  
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.

  
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

  
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

  
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

  
where nothing is poisoned?

  
First of all, we are not thieves.

  
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

  
It's dangerous.

  
I know
I'm supposed to hate humans,

  
but there's something about them.

  
They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.

  
I mean,
just look at what they do with food.

  
GUS TEAU ON TV:
How can I describe it?

  
Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.

  
There is excellence all around you.

  
You need only be aware to stop
and savor it.

  
Oh, Gusteau was right.

  
Oh, mmm, yeah.

  
Oh, amazing.

  
Each flavor was totally unique.

  
But combine one flavor with another,

  
and something new was created.

  
So now I had a secret life.

  
The only one who knew about it
was Emile.

  
Hey, Emile. Emile.

  
I found a mushroomad's gonna...

  
Emile!

  
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

  
We got to cook this.

  
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real question...

  
Yeah.

  
The key is to keep turning it.

  
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

  
That storm's getting closer.

  
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...

  
You got to taste this!

  
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...

  
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

  
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

  
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

  
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

  
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...

  
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!
