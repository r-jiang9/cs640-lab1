is the toast of Paris,
booked five months in advance.
And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine
has made his competitors envious.

Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
Anyone Can Cook!
Climbed to the top of the bestseller list.
But not everyone
celebrates its success.
Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!
What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.
I, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.
