This much I knew:
If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.
But to my dad...
Food is fuel.
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.
Now shut up and eat your garbage.
Look, if we're going to be thieves,
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,
where nothing is poisoned?
First of all, we are not thieves.
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.
It's dangerous.
I know
I'm supposed to hate humans,
but there's something about them.
They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.
I mean,
just look at what they do with food.
GUS TEAU ON TV:
How can I describe it?
Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.
There is excellence all around you.
You need only be aware to stop
