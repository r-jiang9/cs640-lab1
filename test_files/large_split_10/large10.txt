Yeah.
The key is to keep turning it.
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.
That storm's getting closer.
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...
You got to taste this!
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.
Saffron.
- Not good.
Saffron.
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.
I've been down here a million times.
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.
You've been here a million times?
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.
